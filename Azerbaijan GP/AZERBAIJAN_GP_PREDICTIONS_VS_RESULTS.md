2. **Race Incident Handling:** Need better models for predicting DNFs and crashes
3. **Team Form:** Williams' improvement wasn't captured in historical data
4. **Track-Specific Factors:** Baku's unique characteristics need special consideration

### For Future Predictions
1. **Qualifying Results:** Strong predictor of race performance
2. **Championship Pressure:** Leaders may take more risks
3. **Team Development:** Mid-season improvements can surprise
4. **Track Characteristics:** Street circuits have unique dynamics

## Conclusion

The 2025 Azerbaijan Grand Prix demonstrated both the potential and limitations of machine learning in F1 prediction. While Gradient Boosting showed superior accuracy in predicting the race winner and overall top 10, both models struggled with the unpredictable nature of racing incidents and team performance variations.

**Key Takeaways:**
- **Gradient Boosting** is better for race winner predictions
- **Grid position** is a crucial factor in race outcomes
- **Race incidents** remain the biggest challenge for prediction models
- **Team development** during the season can significantly impact results

The models provided valuable insights while highlighting areas for improvement, particularly in handling race dynamics and unexpected team performance changes.
